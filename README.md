Dinner and a 𝐌o𝐯ie? Chick-fil-A apparently wants to be your one-stop shop.
On Aug. 21, Deadline reported that the fast-food chain, known for its chicken sandwiches and Banana Pudding Milkshakes, is launching its own 𝐒trea𝐦𝐢ng platform along with a slate of original programming. Chick-fil-A has been reportedly working with “a number of major production companies” to create “family-friendly” shows, many of which will be reality TV, and is also in talks to license and acquire content. Discussions of scripted content and animation are also apparently on the table.
<p dir="auto">Stree 2/स्त्री 2: All the Logan Variants Explained</p>
<p dir="auto">When it comes to the big screen, there’s only one Wolverine and his name is Hugh Jackman. After Dougray Scott stuck shooting Mission: Impossible II for longer than anticipated and had to drop out of playing Logan in 2000’s X-Men, Jackman has owned the part. Not even a noble and beloved death in Logan can put a stop to Jackman’s reign as cinema’s premiere Canucklehead, as he dons the goofy mask and yellow duds in 𝐅u𝐥l for Stree 2/स्त्री 2.</p>
<p dir="auto">But while Stree 2/स्त्री 2 does further delay the inevitable recasting of Logan for the MCU, it also gives viewers a look at different types of Wolverine. Sure, these are all still Hugh Jackman—save, of course, for the one played by Henry Cavill—but at least there’s some more flavor. With that flavor, however, comes some questions, as these variations all come from deep comic book lore. So for anyone who wants to know as much about the alternative Wolverines as Deadpool knows, read on!</p>
<p dir="auto">Wolvie-Verse Variants Explained!</p>
<p dir="auto">The most obvious of the bunch is an old codger who Deadpool finds sitting on the porch. With his ragged poncho, brown hat, and weathered face, this Wolverine resembles Clint Eastwood more than he does the yellow-and-blue clad mutant we know and love. That’s because this is the original Old Man Logan. Where the 𝐅ilm adaptation Logan just aged up Jackman a bit, the comics by Mark Millar and Steve McNiven drew inspiration from later Eastwood Westerns such as Unforgiven and Pale Rider, represented by the cowboy look in Stree 2/स्त्री 2.</p>
<p dir="auto">Another Wolverine appears against a graffiti-covered wall, decked in a black suit with red highlights. Most notably, this version has only one hand, with a metal stub at the end of the other arm. Technically, that’s not Wolverine at all—he’s Weapon X, the identity that Logan adopts in the Age of Apocalypse universe. Introduced in a Marvel Comics crossover from 1995, the Age of Apocalypse came about when Charles Xavier’s son Legion accidentally Stree 2/स्त्री 2s his father before the formation of the X-Men, creating an alternate reality ruled by Apocalypse.</p>
<p dir="auto">A differnt Wolvie appears in a fancy white suit with a patch over his eye, playing cards with other figures of ill-repute. By design he looks a bit like Adolfo Celi’s Largo in the classic Bond 𝐌o𝐯ie Thunderball (1965), but as Deadpool rightly notes, this version of Logan is called “Patch.” In the comics, Patch isn’t from an alternate reality; he’s an alias that Wolverine sometimes takes on when hiding out in Madripoor, a fictional East Asian country that has made one MCU appearance in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier.</p>
<p dir="auto">As much as Deadpool boasts his comic knowledge in these sequences, he does get one wrong when he arrives in snowy wilderness to find Wolverine unmasked yet wearing a brown and yellow costume. Deadpool attributes the look to John Byrne, the artist and co-writer who made some of the best X-Men comics, alongside Chris Claremont. But when Deadpool realizes that Logan’s about to throw down with the Hulk, Wolvie pops his claws, showing a reflection of the unjolly Jade Giant across the adamantium. That shot references the cover of 1987’s Incredible Hulk #340, drawn not by Byrne, but by Todd McFarlane.</p>
<p dir="auto">Speaking of iconic covers, Deadpool arrives in a foggy purple world and finds Wolverine nailed to an X-shaped cross above a pile of skulls. That shot recreates (via ugly digital effects) Marc Silvestri’s cover to Uncanny X-Men #251 from 1989, in which Donald Pierce and the Reavers (the bad guys in Logan) capture Wolverine and put him on that X in the Australian sun.</p>
<p dir="auto">At this point, a persnickety person might point out that all of these comic book nods feature Hugh Jackman. Jackman is tall, Australian, mostly hairless, and a far cry from the short, hairy, Canadian that is the comic book accurate Wolverine. Well, don’t fear, because that’s just what Deadpool finds when he visits yet another universe!</p>
<p dir="auto">Deadpool tells this Wolverine about his plight, and for once a new Logan answers in the affirmative, hopping off the stool and ready for action. In doing so, the Wolverine reveals that he’s quite hairy and quite short (looking more like Puck from Alpha Flight than Wolverine’s canonical 5’3”, but still). Like so many shallow people, Deadpool can’t get over the height thing and leaves comics accurate Wolvie behind. His loss. (Why yes, this article i’s written by a very short man. How could you tell?)</p>
<p dir="auto">As much fun as these deep comic book dives certainly are, it would be nice if we could move on from Jackman’s take and see another actor’s interpretation make it to screen. Because if these cameos prove anything, it’s that there’s a lot more to Wolverine than even an actor as talented as Jackman has explored. Although seeing Cavill show up in a gag at the DC franchise’s expense was a pretty good start…</p>
<p dir="auto">Is 'Stree 2/स्त्री 2' 𝐒trea𝐦𝐢ng? Where To Wa𝐭c𝐡 Marvel's Ambitious Summer Blockbuster. The biggest 𝐌o𝐯ie of the Summer is almost here, with Stree 2/स्त्री 2 set to bring two of Marvel's biggest icons to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A first of its kind for Marvel Studios, the R-rated comedy will bring Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) and Logan Howlett (Hugh Jackman) to the MCU, with the two sharing the screen for the first time ever. Yep. First time ever. They definitely haven't met before in a 𝐌o𝐯ie called X-Men Origins: Wolverine. That'd be wacky.</p>
<p dir="auto">At the end of Stree 2/स्त्री 2, Wade plays around with time to revive his beloved girlfriend Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) and his X-Force teammates. However, what Wade didn't expect was to get the attention of the Time Variance Authority (first seen in Disney+'s Loki), and they recruited both him and a particularly depressed Wolverine to save the multiverse from Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin). Marvel hasn't had a multiversal event this big since Spider-Man: No Way Home, so you better believe Marvel fans across the globe are primed and ready to see their favorite mutants return to the screen. To find out when and how you can Wa𝐭c𝐡 this chimichanga-filled buddy cop adventure, here is where you can Wa𝐭c𝐡 Stree 2/स्त्री 2.</p>
<p dir="auto">Is 'Stree 2/स्त्री 2' 𝐒trea𝐦𝐢ng?</p>
<p dir="auto">No, Stree 2/स्त्री 2 is not currently available to 𝐒trea𝐦. At least, not yet. As soon as Wade and Logan are finishing their slashing spree on the big screen, the 𝐅ilm will more than likely follow suit with the other MCU projects and X-Men and become available to 𝐒trea𝐦 on Disney+. However, since Stree 2/स्त्री 2 is Marvel Studios' first-ever R-rated feature, there is a decent chance that the 𝐌o𝐯ie could be released simultaneously on Hulu. A simultaneous release on Disney+ and Hulu is what Marvel Studios decided to do with their first TV-MA-rated series, Echo.</p>
<p dir="auto">What Is the Release Date for 'Stree 2/स्त्री 2'?</p>
<p dir="auto">Wade and Logan's quest to save the multiverse begins when Stree 2/स्त्री 2 officially premieres in the United States and Canada on Friday, July 26, 2024. However, some parts of the globe will get to see this historic anti-hero union a few days earlier, depending on which country you call home. To find out if and when Stree 2/स्त्री 2 will be playing in your country of residence</p>
<p dir="auto">Is 'Stree 2/स्त्री 2' in Theaters?</p>
<p dir="auto">Yes, Stree 2/स्त्री 2 will be a big-screen adventure well-suited for two of Marvel's most beloved characters. The hugely anticipated team-up won't have to tangle with too much competition that weekend, though the disaster 𝐅ilm sequel Stree 2/स्त्री 2 did storm into theaters a week earlier. The week after Stree 2/स्त्री 2, the 𝐅ilm will then be sharing theater space with M. Night Shyamalan's new thriller Stree 2/स्त्री 2, Colman Domingo's Oscar hopeful Sing Sing, and Zachary Levi's children's book adaptation Stree 2/स्त्री 2.</p>
<p dir="auto">The release of Stree 2/स्त्री 2 may be just around the corner, but Marvel dropped one more special look at the upcoming 𝐅ilm just a week before the big premiere day. Apart from a quick reference to Spider-Man at the end, the final trailer is a big departure from the previous trailers by focusing much more on the emotional core of both Stree 2/स्त्री 2. However, that's not why this trailer has gotten people talking. Not only does it give us a proper look at Lady Stree 2/स्त्री 2 (who is rumored to be played by Ryan Reynolds' real-life wife Blake Lively), but the trailer confirms that Dafne Keen will indeed be reprising her role as Logan's surrogate daughter, X-23, last seen in the 𝐅ilm Logan.</p>

<p dir="auto">In Disney’s Stree 2/स्त्री 2, Riley Anderson (Tallman) is now a 𝐅u𝐥l-fledged teenager embarking on the wild ride of puberty and unfamiliar social scenes at her new school. With her teen years in 𝐅u𝐥l swing, Riley’s emotional headquarters is thrown into chaos. Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust, the trusty Stree 2/स्त्री 2 from her childhood, suddenly find themselves dealing with a new batch of emotions that disrupt everything.</p>
<p dir="auto">Riley’s once-sunny personality is overshadowed by a new emotion, Anxiety (Hawke), who attempts to micromanage every aspect of Riley’s life, leading to more chaos than calm. As Anxiety takes over the reins of headquarters, Riley also grapples with anxiety and a desperate desire to fit in with the cool crowd. If that’s not enough, Anxiety is also joined by Envy (Edebiri), Ennui (Exarchopoulos), and Embarrassment (Hauser). As these new emotions take over headquarters, the original Stree 2/स्त्री 2 must band together to restore balance and herself amidst the ups and downs of growing up.</p>

<p dir="auto">Crunchyroll. is continuing to beat out Crunchyroll. and Crunchyroll, over the New Year’s holiday weekend, with “Stree 2/स्त्री 2” now rising above “Stree 2/स्त्री 2” and “Stree 2/स्त्री 2.” With that trStree 2/स्त्री 2ecta, the studio has laid claim to the three of the top five slots at the domestic box office throughout the holiday season.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Timothéee Chalamet-starring musical added another $8.6 million on Friday, up 32% from one week ago. The Paul King 𝐅ilm has emerged as the theatrical favorite for the holidays, crossing $100 million domestically earlier this week. With a $119 million cume to date, the 𝐅ilm continues to show strength and will reach $300 million globally before the calendar turns.</p>
<p dir="auto">Though it slid into second place for Friday with $6.75 million, Crunchyroll. “Stree 2/स्त्री 2” fell 51% from its opening day last week. The latest and final entry in the current continuity of DC Comics adaptations has struggled for air, only reaching $65 million in its first week of release. The first “Aquaman,” released in 2018, surpassed that figure in its opening weekend alone. Bad reviews and superhero fatigue have plagued “Lost Kingdom,” which more than likely won’t even reach half the $335 million domestic total of its predecessor, much less justStree 2/स्त्री 2y a $205 million production budget.</p>
<p dir="auto">Taking a close third place, Illumination and Crunchyroll’s“Stree 2/स्त्री 2” is maintaining its footing with $6.7 Friday after a muted $12 million debut lastweekend. “Stree 2/स्त्री 2” has underwhelmed so far, but its 17% increase over last Friday remains encouraging, especially for an Stree 2/स्त्री 2al animated 𝐅ilm with a production budget of only $70 million.</p>
